### Python Solution for Excel-Based Optimization

To solve your non-linear, non-convex integer optimization problem in Python, we'll leverage xlwings to interact with your Excel file for reading inputs (e.g., upper bounds, factors, constraint limits) and writing back optimized decision variables. Since the constraint relationships are defined via Excel formulas (which are non-convex and non-linear), we'll treat the Excel sheet as a "black box" evaluator: Python will update decision variables in the sheet, trigger recalculation, and read back the constraint and objective values during optimization. This approach avoids replicating complex formulas in code but may be computationally intensive for large iterations due to Excel calls.

For the optimization itself, we'll use SciPy's `differential_evolution` from `scipy.optimize`, as it's suitable for global optimization of non-convex problems. It handles bounds and can be adapted for integers by rounding (though not strictly integer; for true MIP, consider Pyomo with a solver like Couenne if you install it). The problem has 300 variables, so we'll assume it's feasible on a standard machine—test with smaller subsets if needed.

#### Prerequisites
- Install required libraries: `pip install xlwings scipy numpy`.
- Ensure your Excel file is open or specify the path in code.
- Backup your Excel file before running, as we'll modify cells.

#### Step-by-Step Python Implementation
Here's a complete, runnable script. Adjust file paths, sheet names, and cell ranges as needed (based on your description). It reads inputs, defines an objective function that interacts with Excel, sets bounds, and optimizes.

```python
import xlwings as xw
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import differential_evolution

# Step 1: Connect to Excel (assume file is open; or use xw.Book('your_file.xlsx'))
wb = xw.books.active  # Or xw.Book(r'C:\path\to\your_file.xlsx')
sheet = wb.sheets['Sheet1']  # Replace with your sheet name

# Step 2: Read inputs from Excel
# Upper bounds for decision variables (C368:C667)
upper_bounds = np.array(sheet.range('C368:C667').value)

# Factors for objective (K368:K667)
factors = np.array(sheet.range('K368:K667').value)

# Constraint limits (E15:E51)
constraint_limits = np.array(sheet.range('E15:E51').value)

# Number of variables and constraints
num_vars = len(upper_bounds)  # 300
num_constraints = len(constraint_limits)  # 37

# Step 3: Define the objective function (to maximize, we'll minimize the negative)
def objective(x, *args):
    # Write decision variables to Excel (D368:D667)
    sheet.range('D368:D667').value = [[int(var)] for var in x]  # Ensure integers
    
    # Recalculate sheet to update formulas
    wb.app.calculate()
    
    # Read objective value (assume it's in a specific cell, e.g., M1; adjust as needed)
    # If not, calculate SUMPRODUCT in Python for efficiency
    # obj_value = sheet.range('M1').value  # If pre-calculated in Excel
    obj_value = np.dot(x, factors)  # Direct calculation if factors are static
    
    # Read constraint values (I15:I51)
    constraints = np.array(sheet.range('I15:I51').value)
    
    # Penalize if any constraint violated (add large penalty)
    penalty = 0
    for i in range(num_constraints):
        if constraints[i] > constraint_limits[i]:
            penalty += 1e6 * (constraints[i] - constraint_limits[i])  # Harsh penalty
    
    # Return negative objective (for maximization) plus penalty
    return -obj_value + penalty

# Step 4: Set bounds (non-negative integers up to upper_bounds)
bounds = [(0, ub) for ub in upper_bounds]

# Step 5: Run optimization (differential evolution for non-convex)
result = differential_evolution(
    objective,
    bounds=bounds,
    args=(),  # No extra args needed
    strategy='best1bin',  # Good for global search
    maxiter=100,  # Adjust based on problem size; higher for better results
    popsize=15,  # Population size; increase for diversity
    tol=0.01,  # Convergence tolerance
    mutation=(0.5, 1),  # Mutation parameters
    recombination=0.7,  # Crossover probability
    workers=1,  # Single-threaded; set higher if no Excel conflicts
    integrality=[True] * num_vars  # Enforce integers (SciPy 1.4+)
)

# Step 6: Write optimized variables back to Excel
optimized_vars = [int(var) for var in result.x]
sheet.range('D368:D667').value = [[var] for var in optimized_vars]

# Recalculate and print results
wb.app.calculate()
final_obj = -result.fun  # Since we minimized negative
print(f"Optimization successful: {result.success}")
print(f"Final objective value: {final_obj}")
print(f"Message: {result.message}")

# Save and close if needed
# wb.save()
# wb.close()
```

#### How It Works
- **Reading/Writing**: xlwings pulls upper bounds, factors, and limits. It updates decision variables in D368:D667 and reads back constraints from I15:I51 after recalculation.
- **Objective**: Calculated via `np.dot` for efficiency (assuming static factors), but you can switch to reading an Excel cell if dynamic. We negate it for maximization.
- **Constraints**: Handled via penalty method—violations add a large cost to discourage infeasible solutions. For stricter enforcement, use Pyomo's constraint definitions if you can express formulas mathematically.
- **Optimization**: `differential_evolution` performs a global search, suitable for non-convex problems. It runs ~100 iterations; monitor performance and increase if needed. For true global optima in MINLP, install Pyomo (`pip install pyomo`) and a solver like Couenne, then adapt the code (e.g., define a model with abstract constraints calling Excel).
- **Integer Handling**: Variables are rounded to integers when written to Excel, and `integrality=True` enforces this in the optimizer.

#### Potential Improvements and Caveats
- **Performance**: With 300 variables and Excel calls per evaluation, this may take time (e.g., minutes to hours). Optimize by minimizing Excel interactions or replicating formulas in Python if possible.
- **Starting Point**: Add `init='latinhypercube'` for better initial population.
- **Advanced Solvers**: If results aren't satisfactory, switch to Pyomo + Couenne for proper MINLP: define variables, objective, and constraints that call a function to evaluate via xlwings.
- **Testing**: Run on a small subset (e.g., 10 variables) first. If you share sample data or formulas, I can refine the code further.
- **London-Specific Note**: If you're running this late (current time: 10:14 PM BST), consider scheduling for off-peak hours to avoid Excel responsiveness issues.

This should get you a working solution—let me know if you encounter errors or need tweaks!
