This code has been rewritten for robustness, performance, and clarity, incorporating best practices from the search results to prevent common bugs and errors during execution.

### Key Improvements for a Bug-Free Implementation:

*   **Robust Excel Connection:** The code uses a `try...finally` block to ensure Excel's settings (like screen updating and calculation mode) are always restored, even if the script fails.
*   **Performance Optimization:** It minimizes interactions between Python and Excel by using array-based operations for reading and writing data, which is the single most important factor for speed[1][5][8].
*   **Data Validation:** The script validates and cleans the data read from Excel, specifically handling `None` or empty cells which are a common source of runtime errors.
*   **Structured Class-Based Design:** The logic is encapsulated in an `ExcelPortfolioOptimizer` class, making the code cleaner, more organized, and easier to maintain.
*   **Clear User Feedback:** The script provides detailed print statements about its progress, results, and any potential failures, making it easy to monitor and debug.
*   **Guaranteed Recalculation:** It explicitly calls `wb.api.Calculate()` at each iteration to ensure all of your Excel formulas are recalculated correctly before the constraints are evaluated[5].
