### Updated Python Solution with Greedy Incremental Algorithm

Based on your request, I've switched to a new algorithm: a **Constraint-Aware Greedy Incremental Search**. This approach ensures constraints are **strictly respected** at every step (no penalties or infeasible solutions are considered—only moves that keep all constraints satisfied are accepted). It works by **incrementally increasing decision variables** one unit at a time, prioritizing variables with the highest potential impact (based on their factors from K368:K667). If increasing a variable would breach a constraint, it reverts the change immediately and moves on to try increasing another variable instead. This "greedy" strategy focuses on maximizing the objective while building a feasible solution step by step, making it suitable for your semi-linear constraints.

#### Why This Algorithm?
- **Strict Constraint Enforcement**: We check constraints after each proposed increase via Excel recalculation. If breached, we undo the change and skip to the next variable.
- **Incremental ("Molecular") Increases**: Variables are bumped up by 1 unit at a time, allowing fine-grained control and quick reversion.
- **Greedy Prioritization**: Variables are sorted by descending factor value (higher factors contribute more to the objective), so we try to maximize high-impact ones first.
- **Revert and Redirect**: If a breach occurs, we revert and shift focus to lower-priority variables, ensuring progress without getting stuck.
- **Efficiency**: Fewer Excel calls than population-based methods; focuses on sequential improvements. For 300 variables, it should run quickly (e.g., seconds to minutes).
- **Starting Point**: As per your previous request, we initialize at one quarter of the upper limits (clipped to integers), then build incrementally from there.

This is a heuristic, not a global optimizer, but it's fast, deterministic, and guarantees feasibility—ideal for semi-linear problems where greedy choices often yield good results. If it doesn't find the absolute maximum, you could combine it with a final hill-climbing polish.

#### Updated Script
Here's the complete, runnable Python code. It replaces the hill-climbing class with this new greedy approach. Adjust sheet names or ranges as needed.

```python
import xlwings as xw
import numpy as np

# Connect to Excel
wb = xw.books.active
sheet = wb.sheets['Sheet1']  # Replace with your sheet name

# Read inputs from Excel
upper_bounds = np.array(sheet.range('C368:C667').value)
factors = np.array(sheet.range('K368:K667').value)
constraint_limits = np.array(sheet.range('E15:E51').value)

num_vars = len(upper_bounds)  # 300
num_constraints = len(constraint_limits)  # 37

def evaluate_feasibility(x_int):
    """Check if solution is feasible by writing to Excel and reading constraints"""
    # Write to Excel and recalculate
    sheet.range('D368:D667').value = [[val] for val in x_int]
    wb.app.calculate()
    
    # Read constraints
    constraints = np.array(sheet.range('I15:I51').value)
    
    # Check if all constraints are satisfied
    is_feasible = all(constraints[i] = max_attempts_per_var:
                continue  # Skip if we've tried this variable too many times
            
            # Propose incremental increase
            proposed = current_solution.copy()
            proposed[idx] = min(proposed[idx] + increment_size, upper_bounds[idx])
            
            # Check if increase is possible (not at bound)
            if proposed[idx] == current_solution[idx]:
                attempts[idx] += 1
                continue
            
            # Evaluate feasibility
            if evaluate_feasibility(proposed):
                # Accept if feasible (increases objective since factors are positive?)
                current_solution = proposed
                improved = True
                attempts[idx] = 0  # Reset attempts on success
                print(f"Iteration {total_iterations}: Increased var {idx} to {proposed[idx]}. Objective: {np.dot(current_solution, factors):.2f}")
                break  # Move to next iteration after successful increase
            else:
                # Revert (don't update) and increment attempts
                attempts[idx] += 1
                print(f"Iteration {total_iterations}: Breach detected for var {idx}—reverting and trying next.")
    
    # Final write-back
    sheet.range('D368:D667').value = [[val] for val in current_solution]
    wb.app.calculate()
    
    final_objective = np.dot(current_solution, factors)
    print("\nOptimization Complete!")
    print(f"Final objective value: {final_objective:.2f}")
    print(f"Total iterations: {total_iterations}")
    
    return current_solution, final_objective

# Run the optimization
print("Starting Greedy Incremental Optimization...")
best_variables, best_objective = greedy_incremental_optimize(max_attempts_per_var=upper_bounds.max())  # Set high to allow full increases

# Optional: Save results
# wb.save()
```

#### How It Works
- **Initialization**: Starts at 25% of upper bounds (integer-rounded). Falls back to zeros if infeasible.
- **Priority Queue**: Variables are ordered by factor descending—try to boost high-value ones first.
- **Incremental Loop**: For each variable in priority order, attempt a +1 increase. Check feasibility via Excel. If good, accept and reset attempts; if not, revert, mark an attempt, and try the next variable.
- **Breach Handling**: Immediate reversion—no infeasible states are kept. If a variable fails too many times (e.g., 100 attempts), it's skipped to focus elsewhere.
- **Termination**: Stops when no further improvements are possible without breaches.
- **Objective Calculation**: Done locally with `np.dot` for speed, assuming positive factors (common for maximization).

#### Potential Tweaks and Caveats
- **Increment Size**: Currently +1 for true "molecular" increases. Change `increment_size` to 5 or 10 for faster but coarser steps.
- **Performance**: With 300 variables and semi-linear constraints, it should converge quickly. If constraints are tight, it may not reach the global max—run the previous hill-climbing script afterward for refinement.
- **Assumptions**: Assumes factors are positive (increasing variables improves objective). If not, we'd need to adjust the greedy logic.
- **Time Sensitivity**: It's now 10:46 PM BST in London— if this is time-intensive, test on a subset of variables first.

This should give you a robust, constraint-safe solution. If results aren't optimal or you meant something different by "molecularly," provide more details for refinements!
